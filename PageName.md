This projects aims to build a sort of "last man standing" robo rally, where players compete with their Javascript object.

    * Movements
      * forward, one or two spaces
      * left (turns before move)
      * right
    * Eliminate player (shoot) (straight forward, 3 spaces).
    * Look
  * Playground is plain simple without anything. Configurable size.
  * Robots will get feedback if they hit players with laser and if they are blocked from moving.
